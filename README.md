# Plant-Measure
This program runs on windows.

Using the left button you can draw lines, tracking the root growth or the leaf area. Each line is associated with an index. For each index you will get the length of the line, the Delta_length (the distance from start to end), the angle of the line drawn from start to end (0ยบ is horizontal pointing RIGHT, 90 is pointing DOWN, 180 LEFT and 270 pointing UP) and finally the area of the figure you drew.
The results will be given in a .txt file, in a table. They do not have units, but if you have a scale in your picture you can calculate the units.
